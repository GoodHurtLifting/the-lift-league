    description: "The Lift League Push Pull Legs is an excellent program for beginners. Combining compound lifts and muscle-isolating exercises, the Push Pull Legs hits each muscle group while providing extended recovery time before retraining. If you are new to weightlifting, grab the PPL and a league coaching session. We'll have you kicking ass in the gym in no time. For anyone new to weightlifting, start with weight amounts that allow you to comfortably perform each recommended rep scheme. Study the reference video linked to the name of each exercise. Follow the notes included with each exercise and gradually add weight every week while focusing on maintaining good form. If you want more practice, repeat the program. There is no pressure to advance.",
